Create a New Branch on GitHub
On GitHub, access your repository and click the "master" branch button.
There you can create a new Branch. Type in a descriptive name, and click Create branch
The branch should now be created and active. You can confirm which branch you are working on by looking at the branch button. See that it now says "html-skeleton" instead of "main"?
